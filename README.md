# Introduction
MyStudylink is an online webapp used by tertiary students, MyStudyLink functions as a tool and resource for students to apply for applications and submit information to the Ministry of Social Development.

MyStudyLink was selected as the product base of my UX research because the webapp itself hasnâ€™t seen a front-end update in the past five years, I have personally used the app. 

Also I have had to guide friends through the webapp to apply for student loans and student allowances. If the product requires previous experience to easily use the web app, MyStudyLink could improve in user-accessibility.
