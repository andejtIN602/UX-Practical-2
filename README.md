# Introduction
MyStudylink is an online webapp used by tertiary students, MyStudyLink functions as a tool and resource for students to apply for applications and submit information to the Ministry of Social Development.

MyStudyLink was selected as the product base of my UX research because the webapp has not seen a front-end update in the past five years, I have personally used the app. 

Also I have had to guide friends through the webapp to apply for student loans and student allowances. If the product requires previous experience to easily use the web app, MyStudyLink could improve in user-accessibility.   

# MyStudyLink User Survey

This survey was used as a tool for my UX research, the intend is to gather data from users of the app.

I requested people who have experience using the MyStudyLink site to fill out this survey to gather relevant data on aspects of MyStudyLink that cause issue with users.
The structure of this survey is designed to focus on the most recent experience the user has had using the software and issues related to that experience to isolate issues users
experience, leading to more investigation, research and attempts at a solution to the existing issue the user is experiencing.
